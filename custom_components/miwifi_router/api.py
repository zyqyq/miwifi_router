"""MiWiFi Router API Client with stok session management.

Key design decisions (inspired by dmamontov/hass-miwifi patterns):
- Stok (session token) is kept alive as long as the router accepts it.
  We do NOT expire the stok locally — the router maintains server-side session
  state and will return 401 when the session truly expires. Only then do we
  re-login.
- Login uses a FRESH aiohttp session to avoid stale cookie interference.
- Before the FIRST login, we call logout() to clear any stale server-side
  session from a previous run (e.g., from config_flow or HA restart).
- On login failure with one hash algorithm, we try the OTHER algorithm
  once (since "not auth" per dmamontov Issue #62 means wrong hash, not
  session conflict — retrying the same hash is pointless).
- Hash algorithm auto-detection:
  Before login, we try to read init_info WITHOUT authentication from TWO
  URL paths:
    1. /api/xqsystem/init_info              (new firmware, e.g. BE5000)
    2. /cgi-bin/luci/api/xqsystem/init_info (old firmware, e.g. AX3600)
  If it contains newEncryptMode=1, the router uses SHA256+SHA256 — we try
  SHA256 first.
  Otherwise (newEncryptMode=0 or missing, OR init_info unreachable on both
  paths), the router uses SHA1+SHA1 — we try SHA1 first.
  On login failure, we automatically try the OTHER algorithm once.
  Switching is NOT tied to error message text (some firmware returns
  English "not auth" instead of Chinese "密码错误"; per dmamontov Issue #62,
  "not auth" simply means "wrong password/hash", not session conflict).
  Total: at most 2 HTTP login requests (1 per algorithm).
  User can also force a specific algorithm via force_hash_algo to skip
  auto-detection and fallback entirely.

v1.3.10: Revert nonce format to 4-part (regression fix).
  Symptom (from user HA log 2026-06-17 20:00):
  - v1.3.6 user with router at 172.16.1.1 was working fine
  - After upgrading to v1.3.9, login failed with 'not auth' on BOTH
    SHA256 and SHA1 algorithms
  - Root cause: v1.3.9 changed nonce format from 4 parts
    (0_MAC_TS_RAND) to 5 parts (0_MAC_TS_RAND_COUNTER), and this
    router strictly validates nonce format — rejects 5-part nonces
    with 'not auth' (not even 'Invalid nonce', which made it look
    like a hash problem).
  Fix:
  - Revert nonce to 4-part format: 0_MAC_TIMESTAMP_RANDOM
    (matches dmamontov/hass-miwifi and router's JS Encrypt.nonceCreat)
  - Keep real client MAC from uuid.getnode() (this part didn't cause
    the regression and is more correct than the placeholder)
  - Keep the code=1582 Invalid nonce retry logic in _login() — this
    still handles the rare case where two logins in the same second
    produce identical timestamps. The router will reject the second
    one with code=1582, we wait 2s and retry (timestamp advances).
  - Removed _nonce_counter class variable (no longer needed).

v1.3.9: Fix "Invalid nonce" error caused by rapid re-login.
  Symptom (from user HA log 2026-06-17):
  - test_connection() logged in successfully, then logged out
  - 300ms later, coordinator's first refresh tried to login again
  - Both nonces shared the same Unix second timestamp
  - Router rejected the second one with {'code': 1582, 'msg': 'Invalid nonce'}
  - Old code then wrongly switched to SHA256 (which also failed)
  - Eventually succeeded on a 3rd attempt after creating a fresh client
  Fix:
  - Use real client MAC in nonce (uuid.getnode()) instead of placeholder
    "00:00:00:00:00:00". Matches what router's JS Encrypt.oldPwd() does,
    and matches dmamontov/hass-miwifi behavior.
  - Recognize code=1582 "Invalid nonce" specifically: this is NOT a wrong
    hash problem, so DON'T switch algorithm. Instead, wait 2s for router
    to release the previous session, then retry the SAME algorithm.
  - Add a class-level nonce counter to guarantee uniqueness within same
    second (extra entropy beyond timestamp + random).
  - Demote all [DEBUG]-tagged log statements from warning to debug level.
    Users who want detailed login diagnostics should enable debug logging
    for the miwifi_router integration in HA's logger config.

v1.3.7-debug: Enhanced debug logging for login authentication troubleshooting.
  Every step of the login process now logs detailed info including:
  - nonce generation, inner/outer hash computation
  - full response bodies from init_info and login
  - cookie headers and redirect tracking
  - hash algorithm detection and switching details

v1.3.8: Fix critical login failure on old-firmware routers.
  Root cause (from user HA log 2026-06-16):
  - Router returned `{'code': 401, 'msg': 'not auth'}` for SHA256 login attempts
  - Old code only switched to SHA1 when msg contained "密码错误" (Chinese),
    but router returned English "not auth" → SHA1 fallback never triggered
  - init_info URL only tried /api/xqsystem/init_info (404 on old firmware),
    not /cgi-bin/luci/api/xqsystem/init_info
  Fix (per dmamontov/hass-miwifi Issue #62 analysis):
  - Try BOTH init_info URL paths (with and without /cgi-bin/luci/ prefix)
  - Trust init_info detection as first attempt:
    * newEncryptMode=1 -> try SHA256 first, then SHA1
    * newEncryptMode!=1 or init_info unreachable -> try SHA1 first, then SHA256
  - Each algorithm is tried AT MOST ONCE (not auth = wrong hash, retrying
    same hash is pointless). Total: 2 HTTP requests max.
  - Switching is NO LONGER tied to error message text.
  - Added optional force_hash_algo parameter for manual override (locks
    algorithm, no fallback).

        when not forced; (1 + MAX_NONCE_RETRIES) when forced.
